# CI Audit Ledger

One row per workflow run. `verdict` is:

* **CLEAN** — every step did what it was supposed to do.
* **DEGRADED** — the run completed but something silently did less than intended.
* **BROKEN** — a step failed or produced wrong output.

**`conclusion: success` is not evidence.** Every core step in `daily-picks.yml`
except `Run tests` carries `continue-on-error: true`, so the job is green
whenever the runner survived. Verdicts below come from reading each log, not
from the conclusion field.

Logs are saved under `ci_logs/run_<id>/full.log` (gitignored, per the existing
repo convention — re-fetch with `gh run view <id> --log`).

Audited by `.claude/commands/daily-ci-audit.md`.
